🌿 Django Portfolio Website – Complete Guide (By Ayush Tiwari)
📘 Overview

This project is a personal portfolio website built using Django.
It contains 4 main sections:

🏠 Home

📄 Resume

💻 Projects

📬 Contact

The goal is to create a clean and professional portfolio where you can showcase your skills, projects, and contact details — all in one place.
We’ll deploy this project using Replit.

⚙️ Step 1 — Project Setup

Open Replit.com
.

Click “Create Repl” → Search Django → Select Template.

Give your project name, e.g. portfolio.

Wait till Replit installs Django automatically.

Once the environment is ready, you’ll see a few default files like:

manage.py
portfolio/
home/

🧱 Step 2 — Create an App

Inside Replit shell, type:

python manage.py startapp home


This creates a new app folder named home which will handle all portfolio pages.

Now go to settings.py and add "home" inside INSTALLED_APPS.

🧭 Step 3 — Create URLs for Navigation

Inside your home app, create a file named urls.py and connect it to main urls.py.

We will make routes for:

/ → Home

/resume → Resume

/projects → Projects

/contact → Contact

This allows us to navigate easily between pages.

🏗️ Step 4 — Create Views for Each Page

In home/views.py, create 4 simple functions:

home() → displays introduction

resume() → shows resume link

projects() → displays project cards

contact() → shows social links (email, GitHub, LinkedIn, LeetCode)

Each function will render a different HTML template.

🖼️ Step 5 — Make HTML Templates

Now create a folder:

home/templates/home/


Inside it, make 4 HTML files:

index.html → for Home page

resume.html → for Resume section

projects.html → for Projects

contact.html → for Contact

Use a base.html for common navbar, footer, and styling.

Each section will extend base.html using {% extends 'home/base.html' %}.

🎨 Step 6 — Add Design (Green Theme)

We’ll make a green-themed layout with clean modern typography using Poppins font.
Main design elements:

Sticky navbar (Home | Resume | Projects | Contact)

Section-based layout

Green buttons and highlights

Responsive cards for project display

You can store CSS inside:

static/css/style.css


The color palette:

Dark Green: #008060

Light Green: #00a97f

Background: #e9fff1

📄 Step 7 — Home Section

The Home section introduces Ayush Tiwari with:

A short intro line (developer, skills)

Social links (GitHub, LinkedIn, LeetCode)

A friendly greeting (👋)

Purpose: give the visitor a quick idea of who you are and what you do.

📃 Step 8 — Resume Section

This section contains:

A brief note like “You can download my resume below”

A button linking to your actual Google Drive resume

Example:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R4R4Yb_AyushResumeLink


(Replace it with your actual resume link.)

💻 Step 9 — Projects Section

This is one of the most important parts of your portfolio.
We’ll use cards layout to showcase each project with title, short description, and link.

Example projects:

Fabric Optimizer

A web app that optimizes fabric usage in clothing production.

🔗 https://fabricoptamizer.onrender.com

Lost and Found Portal

A Django-based portal for reporting and finding lost items.

🔗 https://lost-and-found-377u.onrender.com

Bangalore House Price Prediction

A machine learning project predicting property prices using Python and scikit-learn.

🔗 https://github.com/AyushTIW30/Bangalore-House-Price-Prediction

📬 Step 10 — Contact Section

This section displays your contact and profile links:

📧 Email: ayushtiwariatcoon@gmail.com

📞 Phone: +91 8305117567

💻 GitHub: github.com/AyushTIW30

🔗 LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/ayush-tiwari-2301222ba

🧠 LeetCode: leetcode.com/u/AyushTIW30

Make these clickable links with icons or styled buttons for a clean look.

🌐 Step 11 — Run & Test on Replit

Go to the Shell in Replit.

Run migrations:

python manage.py migrate


Start your server:

python manage.py runserver


You’ll get a Replit URL like:
https://portfolio-yourusername.repl.co

Open it in your browser to see your live Django portfolio website!

💚 Step 12 — Final Touches

Add favicon & title (Ayush Tiwari | Portfolio)

Add footer: “Made with 💚 by Ayush Tiwari”

Use green hover effects for links

Add slight animation for scroll-up or hover cards (optional)

🚀 Optional — Deployment

Since Replit already gives a public URL, it’s auto-hosted.
But if you want more control, you can also deploy this on Railway or Render in the future.
